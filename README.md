# Semana-OmniStack-Rocketseat

The OmniStack Week is a online workshop created by [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat). On this workshop, ministered by [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g), was developed a complete project (backend, frontend and mobile) to help users register NGOs and their new incidents and, thus, other users can help them.

### **To run the project:**
To do that, you have to get the project from this remote repository by doing 

```
~ git clone https://github.com/higor21/OmniStack-Week-Rocketseat.git 
```

And now, you have to install and run all the dependencies from ***frontend***, ***backend*** and ***mobile*** projects. To do that, enter in those folders and execute the following command:

```
# for 'frontend' and 'backend'
~ yarn install
~ yarn start

# for mobile, if you don't have Expo CLI installed, execute 
~ yarn global ad expo-cli
# And after that, execute
~ expo install
~ expo start
```

Now, wait and you will see a new page in [localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002/). So, connect your android/ios emulator or download the Expo app from PlayStore/AppStore, active the Developer Options on your smart phone and read the QR code with the Expo app.
